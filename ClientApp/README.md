This is my submission of the MAPSTED assessment. A few comments: Input value can take 500 single digit values(for now).I tried to use !this.state.userArray.some(isNaN) to see if the input is truely just integers, but I was getting an error saying some is not a function, with more time I could solve this. I was unable to account for double, int or string in my method. I tried to bugfix with using dynamic instead but changing int-long values did not let that happen so I ran out of time. I was also unable to show the steps due to the methods in the surver overwritting my jagged array. I would love to talk about these issues with you, other than that everything else is working fine! Thank you for considering me and this project will be a great addition to my portfolio.
